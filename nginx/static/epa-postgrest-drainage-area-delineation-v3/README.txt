 Conversion of EPA Ofm-based Navigation Delineation service to utilize instead an ArcGIS Server geoprocessing service as the middleware.  May execute against either EPA watersgeo ArcGIS Server utilizing an Oracle database or an EPA geocloud ArcGIS Server utilizing a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database.

The PostgreSQL version offers a prototype initial catchment splitter which is not currently available from the Oracle version.
